## Guidelines for contributors:
 
Keep in mind that you should try to make your code somewhat generic and add enough comments to explain how it works so that it is like a tutorial for others when they read it. 
 
Also, I have been naming files with a loose naming convention that I try to make the main topic uppercase so it's really easy to spot what a file is about.  Please try to name your files the same way or let me know if you have a better naming convention that you think we should follow.
